				"Under normal circumstances, Applied Energistics ships with a requirement to work with Channels. Effectively, each ME Controller can output 32 channels per face, cables have a maximum number of channels they can support, and most things you connect to your ME network will consume a channel. This would typically mean that if you need more channels, you will need more ME controllers."
				""
				"In such a situation, you would also need to be a lot more careful about cable management. You would need to use the coloured cables to keep cable runs separate and stop channels mixing unintentionally too."
				""
				"As you're just starting out, and there's really no need to make your miserable life more difficult than it already is out there in Outpost 42, we've disabled the channel requirements. For your infomation only, using Smart cables will still show the number of channels that would be used - but things will keep working even if the limit is exceeded (special thanks to one of our Science Division AI's, designated Domaman202)"
				""
				"We've also managed to include a spare ME Controller for you - have fun!"
